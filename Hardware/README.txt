# Read me for the USB-C demo board

This project is created using KiCAD (v5.1.6).

The goal of this demo board is to test and evaluate:
* The USB-C interface for a Micro-controller such as ESP8266 or ATmega2560
* Implementation of an onboard battery to power the board when disconnected from power.
* Onboard battery charging capability using USB-C.
